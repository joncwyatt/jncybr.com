            This Privacy Policy describes how Jon Wyatt (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, or
            &ldquo;our&rdquo;) handles your information when you use the Park Visit Log mobile
            application (the &ldquo;App&rdquo;). Park Visit Log is designed with your privacy as a
            priority &mdash; your personal data stays on your device and is never collected or
            transmitted by us.

                All data you create in Park Visit Log &mdash; including visit logs, dates, notes, photos,
                wishlists, and achievements &mdash; is stored exclusively on your device using Apple&rsquo;s
                SwiftData framework. We do not operate servers that receive, store, or process your personal
                data. Your visit history never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export it
                using the app&rsquo;s built-in backup feature, which saves a file to a location you control.

                Park Visit Log does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information, usage
                analytics, crash reports, or device identifiers. We do not use any analytics SDKs,
                advertising frameworks, or tracking technologies. We have no mechanism to know which
                parks you have visited, how often you use the App, or any other details about your
                activity.

            <p class="policy-section__body">
                The App connects to the National Park Service Data API
                (https://developer.nps.gov/api/v1) to retrieve publicly available park information
                such as alerts, operating hours, entrance fees, and gallery photos. These requests
                include only a park code (e.g., &ldquo;yose&rdquo; for Yosemite) and an API key &mdash;
                no personal data, device identifiers, or location information is sent. No other
                third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks are used.

            <p class="policy-section__body">
                Park Visit Log requests access to your location only while you are using the App
                (&ldquo;When In Use&rdquo;). Your location is used for two purposes: displaying your
                position on the in-app map and determining whether you are inside a national park
                boundary for the check-in feature. Location processing happens entirely on your device.
                Your coordinates are never transmitted to our servers or to any third party.

            <p class="policy-section__body">
                With your permission, Park Visit Log may send local notifications to alert you about
                danger warnings or park closures at parks you have visited. These notifications are
                generated entirely on your device based on publicly available alert data retrieved
                from the National Park Service API. No notification data is sent to or processed by
                external servers.

            <p class="policy-section__body">
                Because Park Visit Log does not collect any personal information from any user, it
                does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. The App
                contains no account creation, no data collection forms, and no mechanisms for
                transmitting personal data.
